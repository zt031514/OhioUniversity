#KodiLab-summer2018/caffeTraces

This directory runs several long commands and stores the resulting PIN output files in Output-Files/

The commands run the pintool described at https://github.com/stevenpelley/atomic-memory-trace on the following caffe examples:

1.) MNIST data using the LeNet solver.

2.) CIFAR10 using the CIFAR10 quick solver
