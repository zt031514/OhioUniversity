Task A

	Part 1: Valgrind with curl

	Curl released all of its allocations before exiting, and it did not leak any memory while 		running.

	Part 2 : Valgrind with wc
	
	Again, wc returned all of the bytes it allocated, and no memory was lost while the program 		was running. The test file used was this file before typing this sentence.
